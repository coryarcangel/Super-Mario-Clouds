Super Mario Clouds v2k3.  

I have taken care of some bugs in the older version.  It requires Bob Rost's nbasic, and the 6502 complier nesasm.  It complies on OSX.  A typical compile routine would be like this:

> nbasic clouds.bas -quiet -o clouds.asm 
> nesasm clouds.asm 
> open clouds.nes

Please drag the compilers (nbasic and nesasm) into your BIN directory.
